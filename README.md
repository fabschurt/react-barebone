# `react-barebone`

This experiment stems from the progressive realization that we, as developers,
are somewhat prisoners of our tools. Specifically, we generally start using
tools without reflecting on our actual needs first, just because they are
“industry standards”.

Moreover, each one of our tools, libs, frameworks, etc., impacts the overall
complexity of our projects; the trade-off may be worth the cost, but maybe not.
One more reason to be more thoughtful about our everyday habits.

This is an attempt at putting my needs first (“I need to build a React app”)
rather than blindly following the official guidelines (“I must use
`create-react-app` in order to build a React app”). Let’s see where this takes
us!
